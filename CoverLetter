RE: Data Analyst – Consultant (Requisition ID: 1056)

Dear World Justice Project Selection Committee,

I am applying for the Data Analyst Consultant position to apply my background in Human Rights from U.C. Berkeley and skills in data analysis to the World Justice Project’s research initiatives. My professional profile is characterized by a high comprehension level and a broad, interdisciplinary knowledge base that allows me to solve problems across diverse fields.

I am currently realigning my career with my long-term goals. Having joined my family in the operation of my father’s small business where I focused on modernizing our infrastructure, specifically through implementing a management system where I gained experience in database creation, report and user interface customization. This experience highlighted my aptitude for technical implementation and led me to pursue formal instruction through the TripleTen AI/ML bootcamp to further specialize my skills.

My primary assets include:

Multidisciplinary Problem-Solving: An ability to incorporate knowledge from diverse fields—grounded in my academic work at UC Berkeley, personal research, and professional experience to apply a multi-level multi-modal approach in accomplishing goals and obtaining desired outcomes. 

Technical Adaptability: Proficiency in Python (Pandas, numpy, etc.) for automation in data wrangling and cleaning, and automation of data analysis and reporting. Specifically focused on creating reproducible scripts that ensure data integrity.Data visualization using Matplotlib, and Seaborn which can be expanded on using my graphic design experience to create compelling narratives. 

Information Management: Professional experience in documentation, reporting, confidentiality and utilizing data collaboratively with a team. 

I thrive in roles requiring adaptation and rapid comprehension where I can wear many hats, improve systems, and challenge assumptions. I am interested in the World Justice Project because your work strengthens support for human dignity. The position will allow me to apply my skills, background, logical rigour, and presentation experience in support of this mission. I am ready to apply my versatility to support your Data Analytics Unit as a remote consultant.

Thank you for your time and consideration. Please find my writing sample, a description of how I addressed a research project, below. Unfortunately, the project itself is no longer available. 

Thank you,
Troy Sanders

Analytical Case Study: Human Rights and Military Personnel
The Context:
 While attending UC Berkeley, I was tasked with framing a current event as a human rights issue. At the time, anti-war sentiment often resulted in the dehumanization of service members. I observed that the hostility generated by activities in the Middle East quickly turned toward those enlisted. Despite the negative sentiment present even among my classmates, I chose to investigate the alarming increase in military suicides, using a human rights framework to analyze the issue.


The Framework:
 To move the analysis beyond personal opinion, I applied the International Bill of Rights framework. I evaluated whether the state was meeting its mandates to Respect, Protect, and Fulfill the fundamental Right to Life. This required navigating the legal complexities of the Uniform Code of Military Justice while maintaining that basic human rights remain universal and inalienable.


The Methodology:
I used a methodical approach to investigate potential causes for the rising suicide rates:


 - Qualitative Interviews: I gathered firsthand accounts from three veterans regarding chemical exposures, specifically burn pits and the preventive use of Diazepam.


 - Medical Research: I investigated the chemical pathways of these substances and their physiological effects on the 18–25 age demographic.


 - Comparative Analysis: To test the hypothesis that exposure was a primary driver, I used a study of farmers exposed to Sarin as a control group. By comparing the two datasets, I identified a striking parallel between chemical exposure and the reported suicide statistics.


The Conclusion:
The report concluded that the lack of post-service treatment constituted a failure by the state to provide reasonable protection for those who served. This project demonstrated my ability to use data and comparative research to address complex issues and identify systemic failures.
