RE: Data Analyst – Consultant (Requisition ID: 1056)

Dear World Justice Project Selection Committee,

I am applying for the Data Analyst Consultant position to apply my background in Human Rights from U.C. Berkeley and skills in data analysis to the World Justice Project’s research initiatives. My professional profile is characterized by a high comprehension level and a broad, interdisciplinary knowledge base that allows me to solve problems across diverse fields.

I am currently realigning my career with my long-term goals. Having joined my family in the operation of my father’s small business where I focused on modernizing our infrastructure, specifically through implementing a management system where I gained experience in database creation, report and user interface customization. This experience highlighted my aptitude for technical implementation and led me to pursue formal instruction through the TripleTen AI/ML bootcamp to further specialize my skills.

My primary assets include:

Multidisciplinary Problem-Solving: An ability to incorporate knowledge from diverse fields—grounded in my academic work at UC Berkeley, personal research, and professional experience to apply a multi-level multi-modal approach in acomplishing goals and obtaining desired outcomes. 

Technical Adaptability: Proficiency in Python (Pandas, numpy, etc.) for automation in data wrangling and cleaning, and automation of data analysis and reporting. Specifically focused on creating reproducible scripts that ensure data integrity.Data visualization using Matplotlib, and Seaborn which can be expanded on using my graphic design experience to create compelling narratives. 

Information Management: Professional experience in documentation, reporting, confidentiality and utilizing data collaboratively with a team. 

I thrive in roles where requiring adaptation and rapid comprehension where I can wear many hats, improve systems, challenge assumptions. I am interested in the World Justice Project because your work strengthens support for human dignity. The position will allow me to apply my skills, background, logical rigour, and presentation experience in support of this mission. I am ready to apply my versatility to support your Data Analytics Unit as a remote consultant.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Troy Sanders
